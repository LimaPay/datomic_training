;; Where are we?
;; Note that all three functions (user/construct-map, user/errors, and
;; user/create) can be run either from the peer or inside a
;; transaction. In a web application, you would likely call
;; user/construct-map and user/errors to fail early on known-invalid
;; data, without ever touching the transactor. You could then call
;; user/create to do the work in the transactor, ensuring that the
;; database respected your domain rules. You could also run
;; user/errors against all the users in the database, to see if any of
;; them got into an invalid state somehow (e.g. if validation rules
;; expanded over time, older users might not conform to them.)


;; Enhancement request: Import data from a legacy system, keeping the
;; legacy id for reference. Only showing users here, but note that the
;; legacy system manages other entities we will be importing as well,
;; so the id is :legacy/uuid, not :user/legacy-uuid.

;; because we designed our data functions to be explicit about
;; databases and ids, we can compose new information about users
;; without touching the code for user/create:

                  [:db/add id :db/doc "Jane was in legacy system..."]]))


;; Enhancement request: Batch user creation into a larger transaction
;; Effort required: none
(d/transact conn [[:user/create (d/tempid :db.part/user) "jack@example.com" "Jack Doe"]
                  [:user/create (d/tempid :db.part/user) "jill@example.com" "Jill Doe"]])


;; Enhancement request: Record user creation requests now, play them
;; back later.
;; Effort required: none
(def recorded-tx [[:user/create (d/tempid :db.part/user) "jebd@example.com" "Jebediah Doe"]])
(d/transact conn recorded-tx)

;; Enhancement request: Decouple user creation from the user interface
;; using a queue.
;; Effort required: Put recorded-txes on a queue.  Might choose to
;; also give transactions client-generated identity, which could also
;; be layered in compositionally.
